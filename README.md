# US Debt Tracker Project  

## 📊 Project Overview  
This project explores historical and projected trends in US publicly held debt.  
The dataset provided was raw and required cleaning before meaningful analysis could be conducted. Once prepared, the data was analyzed to answer three key questions about debt growth and seasonal patterns.  

The analysis was conducted in **Excel**, where I performed data cleaning, transformation, and visualization to support my findings.
